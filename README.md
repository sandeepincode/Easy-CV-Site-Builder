# React CV Site Builder
<p>
 Why I built it? I've had a few people ask myself about CV sites, so I decided to simply build a maintainable site where you just modify the JSON. There are options to use CMS APIs but I just chose to keep it simply and let the develop decide what they want to do with the basic shell.
</p>

# What to change
The file path: src/userInfo.json 
<br>
The elements that are inside an array( the square brackets ) can have more elements if you have more skills. For exmaple the education block can be duplicated to add more and the site will adjust.

# How to install?
<ol>
  <li>npm i</li>
<li>npm start, this will launch in your browser</li>
<li>Modify the user info JSON file, hit save!</li>
<li>Go to the browser and enjoy your new site!</li>
</ol>
